"""This program counts how many times it was run.
For this exercise will have to store data outside of memory, and that is accessible each time the program is run, (persistent data). 
We would normally use a database for something like this, but we can use a file.
To make life easier letâ€™s assume that the file already exists. So, we can just read the current count from it then overwrite it with the new count.
Create a file called count.txt and put in 0 into it"""
